# BadNotes
## Description
This is a simple project I'm working on to try out Bun and Neo4j! It's a simple notes application where you can add friends and see each other's notes.

## Local Setup
To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run start

# or 

bun run dev
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.7. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
